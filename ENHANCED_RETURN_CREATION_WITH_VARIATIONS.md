# Enhanced Return Creation with Product Variations

## Overview
Enhanced the `createReturn` function to properly handle product variations when creating returns, ensuring that variation stock is correctly restored and comprehensive variation details are provided in the response.

## Key Enhancements Made

### 1. Enhanced Request Structure
The return creation now expects more detailed information about variations:

```javascript
{
  "saleId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
  "items": [
    {
      "productId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439014",
      "variationCombinationId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439015", // Required for variations
      "quantity": 1,
      "reason": "Defective",
      "condition": "damaged"
    }
  ],
  "returnReason": "Customer return",
  "refundAmount": 125.00,
  "refundMethod": "cash"
}
```

### 2. Improved Validation

#### Product and Variation Validation
- **Product Existence**: Validates that the product still exists in the database
- **Variation Combination Validation**: Ensures the variation combination exists if specified
- **Better Error Messages**: Uses `formatVariationDisplay` for clear error messages

#### Enhanced Matching Logic
- **Precise Matching**: Matches products by both product ID and variation combination ID
- **Standard Product Handling**: Correctly handles products without variations
- **Quantity Validation**: Prevents returning more than originally purchased

### 3. Proper Stock Restoration

#### Variation Stock Restoration
```javascript
if (returnItem.variationCombinationId) {
  // Restore variation combination stock
  const combination = product.variationCombinations.id(returnItem.variationCombinationId);
  if (combination) {
    combination.stock += returnItem.quantity;
    await product.save();
    console.log(`Restored ${returnItem.quantity} units to variation ${combination.combinationName}`);
  }
}
```

#### Standard Product Stock Restoration
```javascript
else {
  // Restore standard product stock
  await Product.findByIdAndUpdate(
    returnItem.productId,
    { $inc: { stock: returnItem.quantity } }
  );
  console.log(`Restored ${returnItem.quantity} units to standard product`);
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Return Item Data Structure

Each returned item now includes comprehensive information:

```javascript
{
  item: {
    product: "507f1f77bcf86cd799439014",
    productName: "Premium T-Shirt",
    sku: "TSH-RED-L",
    quantity: 1,
    unitPrice: 25.00,
    totalPrice: 25.00,
    variationCombinationId: "507f1f77bcf86cd799439015",
    variations: {
      "Color": "Red",
      "Size": "Large"
    }
  },
  returnDate: "2025-07-11T10:00:00.000Z",
  returnReason: "Defective",
  condition: "damaged",
  processedBy: "Store Manager",
  refundAmount: 25.00,
  refundMethod: "cash"
}
```

### 5. Enhanced Response with Variation Details

The response now includes enhanced return items with variation details:

```javascript
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Return processed successfully",
  "return": {
    "saleId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
    "returnedItems": [
      {
        "item": {
          "productName": "Premium T-Shirt",
          "displayName": "Premium T-Shirt - Color: Red, Size: Large",
          "hasVariations": true,
          "variationDetails": {
            "combinationName": "Red - Large",
            "sku": "TSH-RED-L",
            "stock": 48,
            "variations": {
              "Color": "Red",
              "Size": "Large"
            }
          }
        },
        "returnReason": "Defective",
        "condition": "damaged",
        "refundAmount": 25.00
      }
    ],
    "totalRefundAmount": 125.00,
